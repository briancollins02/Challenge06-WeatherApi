# Challenge06-WeatherApi

## Description

This Weather Forcast App functions to deliver a user information about a locations current and projected weather details. As a project, 
it gave me greater understanding into how to call Api data and apply it to a document. I am particularly proud of how I decided to iterate 
through the data instead of assigning every individual value.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this App, type the name of a city and select 'ok' beneath the text-input. The weather data will then be displayed. Previous searches will populate the 
space beneath the search-box and become selectable. Clicking one of these will bring up it's weather data.
